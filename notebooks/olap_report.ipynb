This provides insight into trends in television production over time. This provides insights for network executives and streaming services regarding series longevity trends.

    "This integration of OLAP queries and statistical analysis enhances the analytical capabilities of our data warehouse application. Users can not only explore trends and aggregate information across multiple dimensions (such as year, genre, language, and principal), but also quantitatively validate whether observed differences are statistically meaningful. This combination of descriptive analytics and inferential statistics provides a robust platform for data-driven insights into film and television production, audience reception, and genre-specific trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the statistical analyses presented here represent just a subset of the possibilities supported by our data warehouse. By adjusting query parameters, exploring additional dimensions, or incorporating different metrics, stakeholders can derive further insights into IMDb titles, including deeper genre analysis, director and actor impact, seasonal trends, or entirely new areas of research based on the rich dataset available in our warehouse. This flexibility demonstrates the capability of the OLAP system to support both routine reporting and advanced exploratory analysis."
